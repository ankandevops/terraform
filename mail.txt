I wanted to update you that I’ve successfully installed the required CLI tools — Terraform, Helm, and kubectl — which will be used to deploy the AKS infrastructure.

However, while running terraform init or terraform plan, the process is failing because Terraform is trying to download the AzureRM provider dependencies from the internet. It seems the Cloud PC’s network/firewall restrictions are blocking this download.

Could you please advise how we can handle this?
Possible options might be:

Allowing Terraform to access the provider registry over the internet, or

Hosting the provider binaries internally (e.g., in an approved internal registry or shared storage).

Once this is resolved, I should be able to proceed with the Terraform deployment smoothly.
