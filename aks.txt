Subject: AKS Creation – Status Update

Hi Adam,

I wanted to share the current status of the AKS creation activity, following up on yesterday’s progress.

Yesterday, I had a call with Peter (which I had scheduled) to review the setup steps. During our discussion, Peter requested the SSH key pair, which I did not have access to. As per your suggestion, I reached out to Shiva, who confirmed that he only has the private key (already loaded into Azure) but not the public key.

To proceed, I attempted to generate a new SSH key pair. However, I couldn’t upload the public key to GitHub since neither Shiva nor I have the service account password, and the team responsible for it was on leave. Later, Peter shared a key pair that I was able to use for the configuration.

While running some required Python scripts, I noticed that Python was not installed on my Cloud PC. I have raised a service request to have it installed.

Additionally, during the call with Peter, we had to modify several configuration values that were not documented on the Confluence page. Once the AKS setup stabilizes, I will update the documentation accordingly.

I have another call scheduled with Peter tomorrow morning to continue with the next steps.

Please let me know if you’d like me to summarize the configuration changes separately.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
